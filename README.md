# ReservationSystem

I wanted to create a full web application with .NET Core backend and React Frontend. 
Final site will be a reservation application. Where there are multiple companies, which can have multiple users and products.
Each product can be reserved for a certain time period. Once product is reserved, app sends an email to a reserver and to the reserving company.
Reserving company can see and edit products, prices and reservations through admin panel. 

This is my ongoing project and I haven't host it yet, so unfortunately I don't have a sample site running yet. 

## Why I chosed this tech stack
- PostgreSQL as DB with EF Core. 
      - I chose these, because I use MongoDB in work, but would really love to learn and do things also with relational databases. 
      - PostgreSQL and EF Core combo seemed to be very popular choice, so it would be great to get in touch with it. 
- React
      - React is the most popular frontend framework and I wanted to strenghen my skills with that. Legacy (client) was made with angular. 
      
## Next steps to do
- Add prices to products (Day, Week, Weekend, Special e.g Christmas)
- Lazy loading to photos
- I forgot my password button and functionality
- Silent captcha when entering new reservation
- Host it and let test this in real life.
